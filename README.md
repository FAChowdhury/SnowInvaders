# SnowInvaders*
<p>A Space Invaders clone made with C and SDL, currently a WIP.</p>
<p>The game is primarily made in C with some C++ features such as namespaces for easier readibility.</p>
<p>*The game currently has an art style similar to the original space invaders but the art will be changed to allow the player to play as jinx against the invasion of the poros. This is so I am able to focus on the game logic first.</p>
<h1>Requirements</h1>
<ul>
  <li>CMAKE</li>
  <li>SDL2</li>
  <li>SDL Image</li>
  <li>SDL Mixer</li>
  <li>SDL TTF</li>
</ul>
<h1>How to run the game</h1>
<bold>Run the following command in the terminal in the root directory to make the build file</bold>
```

cmake -B build

```
<bold>Using the terminal, go into the build folder using the following command:</bold>
```

cd build

```
<bold>Once you are in the build folder, enter the following command to build the program:</bold>
```

<bold>After the program finishes building, to run the game enter this final command in the terminal:</bold>
